A basic example
===============

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
$!test_basic!$
<!--(end)-->

<div class="fname">(examples/test_basic.py)</div>

This example should look familiar to anyone who has used the built-in Python
__unittest__ module. The main points to note are:

    * __setUpAll__ and __tearDownAll__ run before and after the group of
    contained tests as a whole.

    * __setUp__ and __tearDown__ run before and after each of the contained
    tests.

    * __pry__ is a tree-based test framework. __AutoTree__ turns methods with
    names of the form "test_*" into test nodes automatically. 

    * Unlike the built-in __unittest__ module, __pry__ does _not_ automatically
    instantiate test suites. Instead, they need to be instantiated manually and
    added to a __tests__ list in the module scope.

    * Test assertions are written using the __assert__ keyword.
    Assertion errors are caught, and the failing expression is parsed and
    re-evaluated to give an informative error message.


Running the tests
=================

You can find the file above at <span>examples/test_basic.py</span> in the
__pry__ distribution. From the examples directory, we can run the tests as
follows:


<pre class="output">
> pry test_basic.py
.E.

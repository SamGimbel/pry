Project Structure
=================

In order to perform coverage analysis, __pry__ must know a few things about the
structure of your project:

    - __coverage__: the path to the base of the module under test.

    - __exclude__: a list of paths that should be _excluded_ from from coverage
      analysis.

    - __base__: the base of the project. This path is added to sys.path so that
      project imports function correctly.

These three parameters are set in the <strong>.pry</strong> configuration file,
which can be placed in any directory containing tests.


:::Example
----------

<pre class="output">
|-- module
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- exclude.py
|   |-- one.py
|   `-- two.py
`-- test
    |-- test_one.py
    `-- test_two.py
</pre>
<div class="fname">(examples/project)</div>

__module__ is the module under test, and __exclude.py__ is a source file
that should be excluded from coverage analysis. The pry unit test suite lives
in a parallel directory called __test__. In this case, the
<strong>.pry</strong> file in the test directory would contain the following:

<pre class="output">
base = ..
coverage = ../module
exclude = ../module/exclude.py
</pre>

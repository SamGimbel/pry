A basic example
===============

$!examples.py("examples/test_basic.py")!$

This example should look familiar to anyone who has used the built-in Python
__unittest__ module. The main points to note are:

    * __setUpAll__ and __tearDownAll__ run before and after the group of
    contained tests as a whole.

    * __setUp__ and __tearDown__ run before and after each of the contained
    tests.

    * __pry__ is a tree-based test framework. __AutoTree__ turns methods with
    names of the form "test_*" into test nodes automatically. 

    * Unlike the built-in __unittest__ module, __pry__ does _not_ automatically
    instantiate test suites. Instead, they need to be instantiated manually and
    added to a __tests__ list in the module scope.

    * Test assertions are written using the __assert__ keyword.
    Assertion errors are caught, and the failing expression is parsed and
    re-evaluated to give an informative error message.


Running the tests
=================

From the <span>examples</span> in the __pry__ distribution, we can run the
tests as follows:

$!examples.pry("examples", "test_basic.py")!$

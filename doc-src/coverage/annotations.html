Many projects contain code that can not be covered by unit tests. Having these
portions show up in test coverage statistics is not helpful, so __pry__
provides a way to annotate code to exempt lines from coverage. 

:::Example
----------

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
$!test_annotation!$
<!--(end)-->
<div class="fname">(examples/test_basic.py)</div>

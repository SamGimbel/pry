__AutoTree__ is a __TestContainer__ class that provides a short-cut for
building trees of related tests. Methods of the form test_* are automatically
turned into __Test__ objects, and added to the container, with names equal to
the method names.

The following code is functionally equivalent to the example given in the
previous section:

<!--(block | pySyntax)-->
$!test_autotree!$
<!--(end)-->
<div class="fname">(examples/test_autotree.py)</div>

Introduction
============

__pry__ test trees consist of two types of nodes:

    - __TestTree__ objects are internal nodes that can contain tests or other
      __TestTrees__. These objects set up and tear down fixtures for the nodes
      they contain.
    - __TestNode__ objects are leaf nodes corresponding to actual unit tests.
      Each __TestNode__ object corresponds to a single test. __TestNode__
      objects must be direct children of a __TestTree__ object.
